# Setup

## Create Virtual Environment

In a terminal run the following commands from the root folder of the forked project.

```
python -m venv venv
```

Once that completes, also run this command from the same folder.

Windows

```
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

macOS & Linux

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now that you are working in the virtualenv, install the project dependencies with the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Verify Setup

In order to verify that everything is setup correctly, run the following command, which should show you the failing tests. This is good! Weâ€™ll be fixing this test once we jump into the build step.

```
pytest
```

Every time you want to check your work locally you can type that command, and it will report the status of every task in the project.

# Working on tasks

In this project you will work your way to import and merge two datasets into one.

## Task 1: Importing Pandas Library
**`@pytest.mark.test_task1`** In order to start working with the project, load the `pandas` library with an alias `pd` at the top of the `tasks/solution.py` file.

## Task 2: Importing the First CSV dataset
**`@pytest.mark.test_task2`** Next, in the same file load the dataset `Code.csv` from the `data` directory using the `pd.read_csv()` method and store the Pandas DataFrame in the `df1` variable.

## Task 3: Importing the Second CSV dataset
**`@pytest.mark.test_task3`** Next, in the same file load the dataset `ISOnum.csv` from the `data` directory using the `pd.read_csv()` method and store the Pandas DataFrame in the `df2` variable.

## Task 4: Merging the dataframe df1 and df2 on column country as a dataframe CountryCode
**`@pytest.mark.test_task4`** To merge the dataframe df1 and df2 on column country use `merge()` function and store the result to a dataframe `CountryCode`.
